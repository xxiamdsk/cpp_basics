01. Define a class Complex with appropriate instance variables and member functions.
One of the functions should be setData() to set the properties of the object. Make
sure the names of formal arguments are the same as names of instance variables.

02. Use this pointer to get the address of caller object. define a class A and a member function that returns the address of caller object.

03. Define a class Complex with appropriate instance variables and member functions. Overload binary (+) to add two complex numbers and use this pointer to access members

04. Create a class Rectangle and include a member function area and a function setDimensions to set width and height of the rectangle. Enable method chaining by returning the this pointer from the setDimensions function.

05. Use this pointer to get the reference of caller object. define a class A and a member function that returns the reference of caller object.
