01. Create a class FLOAT that contains one float data member. Overload (+,-,/) arithmetic operators so that they can operate on the objects of FLOAT.

02. Define a class Rectangle and overload area function for different types of data type.

03. Define a base class Animal having member function sound() . Define another
derived class from Animals class named Dogs. You need to override the sound
function of the base class in the derived class.

04. Define a class Addition that can add 2 or 3 numbers of different data types using
function overloading.

05. Define a class A having multiple constructors. Define another class B derived from class A. Create derived class constructors and show use of constructor in this single inheritance.

06. C++ Program to illustrate the use of Constructors in multilevel inheritance of your choice.

07. C++ Program to illustrate the use of Constructors in single inheritance of your choice.

08. C++ Program to illustrate the use of Constructors in multiple inheritance of your choice.

09. Write a C++ program to calculate the area of triangle, rectangle and circle using
constructor overloading. The program should be menu driven.

10. Create a C++ class for player objects with the attributes: player no., name, number of matches and number of goals done in each match. The number of
matches varies for each player. Write a parameterized constructor which initializes
player no., name, number of subjects and creates an array for number of goals and
number of matches dynamically.
